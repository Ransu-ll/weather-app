okay so, what essentially needs to happen is:
- get a list of all locations that BoM offers forecasting weather
- from each location, collect:
    - minimum temp
    - maximum temp
    - precipitation chance
    - wind? [difficult]
    - precis
- figure out a way to get data for one location from two XML files (BoM wtf???)
-
